Deploying WordPress on an EC2 Ubuntu instance in a microservices architecture typically involves setting up two EC2 instances: one for WordPress and one for the MySQL database. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Set Up Two EC2 Instances:

1. **Launch EC2 Instances:**
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the EC2 service.
   - Launch two new EC2 instances with the t2.micro instance type and Ubuntu AMI.

2. **Configure Security Groups:**
   - Create two separate security groups: one for WordPress and one for MySQL.
   - For the WordPress security group, allow inbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
   - For the MySQL security group, allow inbound traffic on port 3306 (MySQL).

### Install WordPress on EC2 Instance:

1. **Connect to the WordPress EC2 Instance:**
   - Use SSH to connect to the EC2 instance where you'll install WordPress.

2. **Install LAMP Stack:**
   - Update the package repository:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     ```
   - Install Apache, MySQL, PHP, and other necessary packages:
     ```
     sudo apt install apache2 php mysql-server php-mysql
     sudo service apache2 restart
     ```

3. **Download and Extract WordPress:**
   - Navigate to Apache's web root directory:
     ```
     cd /var/www/html/
     ```
   - Download the latest version of WordPress:
     ```
     sudo wget -c http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
     ```
   - Extract the downloaded file:
     ```
     sudo tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
     ```
   - Move the WordPress files to the current directory:
     ```
     sudo mv wordpress/* .
     ```
   - Set permissions:
     ```
     sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/
     sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/
     ```

4. **Configure WordPress:**
   - Access your WordPress EC2 instance's public IP address in a web browser to complete the installation.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to set up WordPress, including providing the database details.
### Complete WordPress Configuration:

1. **Database Configuration:**
   - When prompted during the WordPress installation, enter the database details:
     - Database Name: `wordpress`
     - Username: `root` (MySQL root username)
     - Password: (Enter the MySQL root password set during MySQL installation)
     - Database Host: (Enter the private IP address of the MySQL EC2 instance)

2. **Complete WordPress Installation:**
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the WordPress installation.

3. **Create Welcome Page:**
   - Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard.
   - Go to Pages > Add New.
   - Create your welcome page with the desired content.
   - Publish the page.

### Access Your WordPress Site:

1. Visit your WordPress site by entering the public IP address of the WordPress EC2 instance in a web browser.

That's it! You've now deployed WordPress on an EC2 Ubuntu instance in a microservices architecture.
